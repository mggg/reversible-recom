# Reversible ReCom Replication materials 

The scripts included in this repository can be used to reproduce key figures in  "Spanning trees and political redistricting". Full experimental outputs are not available on GitHub due to size constraints but are available upon request and are generally reproducible with [frcw.rs](https://github.com/mggg/frcw.rs). A Dockerfile for easy running [the `redist` package](https://github.com/alarm-redist/redist) is also provided.
